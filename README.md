# Stress-detection-signals-on-wearable-devices

The purpose of this project is analyse the below data set and detect what signals are most imporatant to detect the stress from BVP . Heart rate, Tempreture , 
ACC, and EDA signals

Repository may contain 2201869.py and 2201869.ipynb  files.

Both files contain same code and .ipynb file for Jupyter notebook.

Data loading to data frame , data preprocessing, model trainng (Random Forest model) and evaluate the performance 

2201869.pdf file may contain how this data can be used to detect stress prediction and what signals are most important when detecting stress

I have analyse the row data available from below link.
